# ðŸ˜‚ Memeify (Meme Generator App)
### CIS 298 - Winter 2025
### Group #19 - Angie Fakih, Jeneen Jadallah, Afrah Mohamed

## Project Overview 
Our group project is a Meme Generator called Memeify that pulls random quotes/jokes from an API and places them onto meme templates. We are using popular Python libraries like Pillow, requests, and Tkinter to create a fun and interactive program. Users will be able to select templates, generate memes, and share them. 

## Tasks & Roles 
We've split the project into three major tasks, and each group member is working on one of them: 

1. API Fetcher (Afrah): Write code to fetch random jokes/quotes from an API. Handle errors and ensure the text returned is clean and ready for use in the meme.

2. Image Editor (Jeneen): Use the Pillow library to add the fetched quote/joke onto a meme template. Handle resizing, positioning, and saving the generated meme.

3. GUI (Angie): Build a user interface (GUI) where users can select a meme template, input a quote, and generate the meme. The interface will allow for seamless meme creation.

## Branching & Workflow
We have structured our work with separate branchs for each task. This allows each team member to work independently on their part without interfering with others' progress. 
- Main Branch: Holds the final project and working meme generator. This is where all pull requests were merged.
- API Fetcher Branch: Afrah worked on this branch.
- Image Editor Branch: Jeneen worked on this branch.
- GUI Branch: Angie worked on this branch.
