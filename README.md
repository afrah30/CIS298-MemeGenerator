# Meme Generator  
### CIS 298 - Winter 2025
### Group #19 - Angie Fakih, Jeneen Jadallah, Afrah Mohamed

## Project Overview 
Our group project is a Meme Generator that pulls random quotes/jokes from an API and places them onto meme templates. We are using popular Python libraries like Pillow, requests, and Tkinter/Flask to create a fun and interactive program. Users will be able to select templates, generate memes, and share them. 

## Tasks & Roles 
We've split the project into three major tasks, and each group member is working on one of them: 

1. API Fetcher (Afrah): Write code to fetch random jokes/quotes from an API. Handle errors and ensure the text returned is clean and ready for use in the meme.

2. Image Editor (Teammate 2, please self-assign): Use the Pillow library to add the fetched quote/joke onto a meme template. Handle resizing, positioning, and saving the generated meme.

3. GUI (Teammate 3 please self-assign): Build a user interface (GUI) where users can select a meme template, input a quote, and generate the meme. The interface will allow for seamless meme creation.

## Branching & Workflow
We have structured our work with separate branchs for each task. This allows each team member to work independently on their part without interfering with others' progress. 
- Main Branch: Holds the initial project and intergrates everything at the end.
- API Fetcher Branch: Afrah will work on this branch
- Image Editor Branch: Teammate 2 (please self assign) will work on this branch.
- GUI Branch: Teammate 3 (please self assign) will work on this branch.

## Commit Breakdown 
1. Initial Commit
- Description: Set up the basic project structure, including the main.py file, requirements.txt, and the folders for each task (API fetcher, image editor, and GUI).
- We created three separate branches for each team member to work on their role/part of the project.
- We separated the tasks into GitHub issues and assigned each teammate to their specific task. Each teammate will focus on their respective modeule while tracking progress through issues.

2. ***Please write any other commits with a description here anytime anything is pushed into repo...***

## Libraries Used 
- Pillow: For image manipulation and meme generation
- requests: To fetch random quotes/jokes from the API.
- Tkinter/Flask: For building the GUI.
- random, os, io: For basic functionality like randomizing meme captions and handling files.

## Next Steps 
***We will continue working on our assigned tasks, commit our progress regularly, and merge everything into the main branch. We'll be updating the README as we go to reflect our progess.***
