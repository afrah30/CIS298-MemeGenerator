# ðŸ˜‚ Memeify (Meme Generator App)
### CIS 298 - Winter 2025
### Group #19 - Angie Fakih, Jeneen Jadallah, Afrah Mohamed

## Project Overview 
Our group project is a Meme Generator called Memeify that pulls random quotes/jokes from an API and places them onto meme templates. We are using popular Python libraries like Pillow, requests, and Tkinter to create a fun and interactive program. Users will be able to select templates, generate memes, and share them. 

## Tasks & Roles 
We've split the project into three major tasks, and each group member is working on one of them: 

1. API Fetcher (Afrah): Write code to fetch random jokes/quotes from an API. Handle errors and ensure the text returned is clean and ready for use in the meme.

2. Image Editor (Jeneen): Use the Pillow library to add the fetched quote/joke onto a meme template. Handle resizing, positioning, and saving the generated meme.

3. GUI (Angie): Build a user interface (GUI) where users can select a meme template, input a quote, and generate the meme. The interface will allow for seamless meme creation.

## Branching & Workflow
We have structured our work with separate branchs for each task. This allows each team member to work independently on their part without interfering with others' progress. 
- Main Branch: Holds the final project and working meme generator. This is where all pull requests were merged.
- API Fetcher Branch: Afrah worked on this branch.
- Image Editor Branch: Jeneen worked on this branch.
- GUI Branch: Angie worked on this branch.

## What We Learned

Throughout this project, our team gained hands-on experience working with a variety of popular and powerful Python libraries. Here are some of the key takeaways:

- **Pillow (PIL):** We learned how to manipulate images programmatically â€” including resizing, text rendering, font scaling, and drawing multiline text with strokes. This gave us a deeper understanding of how image processing works under the hood.

- **requests & APIs:** We learned how to fetch dynamic data from external APIs and handle JSON responses, helping us understand how backend systems communicate with applications.

- **argparse:** Building a CLI with customizable arguments showed us how to create flexible tools that can be run directly from the terminal, improving usability for different users.

- **Modular Design:** Splitting the project into separate modules (`api_fetcher.py`, `image_editor.py`, `main.py`, `gui.py`) helped us practice clean coding principles and maintainable architecture.

- **Version Control & GitHub Collaboration:** We practiced using branches, pull requests, and commit histories to work as a team, resolve merge conflicts, and document progress.

- **User Interfaces (GUI/CLI):** We explored both graphical and command-line interfaces, enhancing our understanding of user experience and interface design.

- **Teamwork & Communication:** We strengthened our collaboration skills by dividing responsibilities, reviewing each otherâ€™s code, and integrating our work into a unified application.

This project not only reinforced Python fundamentals but also taught us how to take an idea from concept to execution in a real-world development environment that is functional and fun!
