# main.py
# This is where everything comes together once we start working on our assigned parts.

# We'll import our different modules here once they're ready.
# Right now they're commented out because we don't have the code yet.

# From the API fetcher
# from api_fetcher.fetch_api import get_random_text  # Will get a random joke/quote from the API

# From the image editor
# from image_editor.meme_editor import create_meme  # Will take the quote and add it to a meme template

# From the GUI/CLI
# from gui.interface import run_interface  # Will create the user interface (either GUI or CLI)

def main():
    print("Welcome to Meme Generator!")
    # This is just the starting point, we’ll test the different parts here later.

    # For now, we’ll just test each part with some placeholders.

    # Testing the API fetcher (once it's ready, we’ll use the function to get a random joke/quote)
    # fetched_text = get_random_text()  # This will eventually get the text from the API
    # print(fetched_text)  # For now, this would just print out the quote or joke

    # Testing the image editor (once we get the text, we’ll create a meme with it)
    # meme = create_meme(fetched_text)  # This will take the quote and put it on a meme template
    # print(f"Generated meme saved at: {meme}")  # Placeholder to see if the meme is generated correctly

    # Run the GUI/CLI (when it's ready, this will start the interface for users to generate memes)
    # run_interface()  # We'll link the interface here when it's ready


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # This runs the main function when we start the program
